# Fantasy Baseball Auction Values

This repository contains code used to create fantasy baseball auction values for all players prior to the 2022 season.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide fantasy baseball players with a comprehensive list of auction values for all players, which can be used as a reference during fantasy baseball drafts for both points and categories leagues.

## How it works

The code in this repository utilizes statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to create player valuations based on a variety of factors, including past performance, age, injury history, and other relevant metrics. These valuations are then used to determine the appropriate auction values for each player in a standard fantasy baseball league.

## Data sources

The data used in this project was obtained from a variety of sources, including public statistical databases, expert rankings, and other publicly available resources.

## Usage

Users can download and run the code in this repository to generate fantasy baseball auction values for all players prior to the 2022 season.
